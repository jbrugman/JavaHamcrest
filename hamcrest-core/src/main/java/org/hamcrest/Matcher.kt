/**
 *
 *
 * A matcher over acceptable values.
 * A matcher is able to describe itself to give feedback when it fails.
 *
 *
 *
 * Matcher implementations should **NOT directly implement this interface**.
 * Instead, **extend** the [BaseMatcher] abstract class,
 * which will ensure that the Matcher API can grow to support
 * new features and remain compatible with all Matcher implementations.
 *
 *
 *
 * When using Hamcrest, there is no guarantee as to how often `matches()` or
 * `describeMismatch()` will be called, so the objects passed as
 * `actual` arguments should not change when referenced. If you're testing a
 * stream, a good practice is to collect the contents of the stream before matching.
 *
 *
 *
 * N.B. Well designed matchers should be immutable.
